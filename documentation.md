## 1.1.1 Background
Many students try to solve Programming problems for fun or learning purposes. 
I think the best way to learning algorithms by reading books or blogs and by solving programming problems.
But it's very difficult to choose the right books and blogs to read and find the right problems to solve.
Many even don't know where to take part in Programming Contests and solve programming problems.
I have built this blog to solve these problems.
This project is created to solve the following problems:
1. One can find some great tutorial links for various known algorithms here. 
2. Topic-wise some great problems to solve.
3. Suggestion about which books to read.
4. List of some great platforms to practice Programming Problems.

## 1.1.2 Wire Frames
I have started from scratch to solve this problem.
After selecting to solve this problem, I have designed a scratch on paper about the layout.
I have decided to build the platform using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.
I decided to use Notepad++ editor.


## 1.1.3 Colour Choices
Deforestation is a global problem.
So, I choose an image of a forest to make awareness.
Also green is good for the eyes.
I colored the states of selected blocks dark green. Because the users should focus on the texts, not on the colors.

This is a responsive website. 
Anyone with a smartphone or a Computer can have full access to this blog.

## 1.2.6 Distance Selling
This website provides free information to anyone.
So, I don't need to provide any information for "Online and distance selling".

## 1.2.7 Evaluation
When I started this project, I just had a very basic knowledge of Web Technology.
Then I learned HTML 5 language and CSS 3 style sheet language for describing the presentation for the blog.
The first problem I have encountered was making the whole structure responsive to all devices.
After searching for hours I found and mastered "CSS Media Queries".
I also learned to apply dynamic sizes based on the browser's display instead of static sizes.
Then I learned JavaScript for updating data on several pages. 
I used "EventListener", "querySelector", and modifying data on HTML page with JavaScript.
I made several coding mistakes along the way.
It took days to find out the bugs.
After completing the project, I have tested this on a laptop, a desktop computer, and on a Mobile phone.
I have learned HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript by completing this project.
