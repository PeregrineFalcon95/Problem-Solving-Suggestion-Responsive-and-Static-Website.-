                <h5 class="bookHeader" ><b>1. Introduction to Algorithms</b></h5>
                <p class="card-text">This book is the Bible of Competitive Coding, beautifully written, a comprehensive textbook that covers all the modern algorithms in-depth. It is a fully organized and definitive introductory book on the design and analysis of algorithms accessible to all levels of readers. Most books on algorithms available in the market are either rigorous and incomplete or cover huge material without rigour but this book is a rare example that uniquely combines both rigour and comprehensiveness. The first half of this book gives an effective method to study algorithms and the second half is focused on more advanced readers and curious students with compelling material on both the possibilities and the challenges in this fascinating field.</p>

                <h5 class="bookHeader">3. Guide to Competitive Programming by Antti Laaksonen</h5>
                <p class="card-text">This is an easy-to-follow, ideal reference book that presents a comprehensive introduction to modern competitive programming. It mainly focuses to learn algorithms by competitive programming to encourage the design of algorithms that work in a real-world problem. This book also improves the debugging skills of a programmer and influence the thinking required to solve problems competitively. The book contains many tips and tricks which can be very useful for any competitive programmers.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="bookHeader">4.  Programming challenges by Steven S Skiena</h5>
                <p class="card-text">This is a well written competitive programming book for self-study, teaching innovative courses in algorithms and programming, and for international competition. International programming contests are the best way to improve your algorithmic and coding skills and for this reason, this book uses programming competition type problems to motivate the study of algorithms and includes more than 100 programming challenges with the necessary theory and key concepts for approaching them. All the interesting problems in this book are well structured by topics to gain a concrete understanding of both algorithmic techniques and advanced coding topics.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="bookHeader">5. The Algorithm Design Manual</h5>
                <p class="card-text">It is one of the best-selling classic books which reveals the mystery behind designing algorithms and analyzing their optimized efficiency. It’s not only the primary textbook of choice for algorithm design courses but also the best practical reference guide to algorithms for programmers, researchers, and students which provides straightforward access to combinatorial algorithms technology. This book also provides many short tips and tricks for designing and analyzing computer algorithms with the catalog of algorithmic resources, implementations, and an extensive bibliography.</p>
